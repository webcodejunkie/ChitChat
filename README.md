# ChitChat —  Messaging Mobile Application

## Application Description & Goal

### Description

To build a chat app for mobile devices using React Native. The app will provide users with a chat interface and options to share images and their location.

### Goal 

This project aims to use React Native, Expo, and Google firestore Database to build a chat app that makes the goal to reduce the amount of codebases that developers would need to maintain.

#### Context

More and more people use their phones for daily tasks, such as shopping, creating to-do lists,
communicating with friends, scheduling meetings, and more. That's why many companies offer native
mobile versions of their web apps, or even skip creating a web app entirely.

In the past, building high-quality mobile apps required a lot of time and money because writing apps
for different platforms like iOS and Android required specialized programmers who could build and
maintain multiple codebases.

Over time, however, new technologies emerged that made it easier for companies to build and
maintain mobile applications using familiar syntax. One of these technologies is React Native, a
framework for building Android and iOS apps that only requires one codebase.

## Key Features

● A page where users can enter their name and choose a background color for the chat screen
before joining the chat.

● A page displaying the conversation, as well as an input field and submit button.

● The chat must provide users with two additional communication features: sending images
and location data.

● Data gets stored online and offline.
